Sift AI is a _blazingly fast_ :fire: file searching library that lets you gain access to your knowledge bases from one central location.

## Development 

Sift is built with Tauri and Bun. To run, do the following: 

```bash 
git clone [repo_url]
# and 
cd siftai
# and 
bun install
# and 
bun dev # in one terminal 
# and 
bunx tauri dev # in the other (to run the app) 
```
